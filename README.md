# NEXA - Student Workload Management Tool

A student-focused web application designed to centralise assignment tracking, task management, and academic workload within a single interface.

My motivation behind building this project was to address how overwhelming managing academic work across multiple disconnected productivity platforms can be. Rather than splitting workflows across different apps, I wanted to create a cleaner, more structured interface that makes it easier to track assignments, organise smaller tasks, and visualise day-to-day workload more effectively. The project has also become a way for me to explore how a practical student-facing tool can evolve from a frontend-driven application initially, into a more complete, full-stack system.
